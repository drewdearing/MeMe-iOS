Deviations:
• Implemented functionalities like searching and loading user profile, but loading may take a bit of time: will speed it up
• Occasionally, after logging in, a malloc error is thrown when loading the feed due to our cache: opening the app again fixes it
• On some of the newer images, when clicking on it, the description does not appear in the screen
• Profile settings is implemented, but the cache is not updated so the changes are not seen



P.S: Not sure if it's going to happen or not, but Yair might drop the class
