Deviations:
• Must manually refresh the user feed by clicking the edit bar button item, then clicking cancel. Then, the picture will show up
• Upvote and downvote buttons don't do anything yet and since we sort by these counts, you can't tell in the discover page that they are sorted
• Editing meme currently consists of adding a description
